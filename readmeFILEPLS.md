1.  Passive Abilities x5 (Health regen while still for example):
	* Player regenerates health
	* Player regenerates ammo (if the weapon he/she is holding requires tradititonal ammo)
	* While Player is above 90% hp, has a chance to not consume ammo (machinegun only)
	* While Player is below 50% hp, shotguns have a largely increased pellot count.
	* Player heals upon killing certain enemies (non-gibbed kills).  
	
	

2.  Add 5 status effects:
	* Upon killing an enemy, gain largely increased damage with the machine gun temporarily.
	* Upon hitting an enemy with a bullet/pellet projectile, you have a chance to temporarily gain reduced damage against that specific enemy, signified by lava-burning sound.
	* Upon hitting an enemy with a bullet/pellet projectile, you have a chance to enter "Bloodrush" and heal for a portion of damage you deal against enemies temporarily.
	* Upon hitting an enemy with a bullet/pellet projectile, you have a chance to make them bleed and take damage over a period of time.  Bleed cannot kill an enemy but can leave them massively weakened. Signified by drowning sound.  
	* Upon hitting an enemy with a blaster projectile from the blaster, you have a chance to "expose" their weak spot and deal massively increased dasmage against them (typically 1 shot kills) but the time window is very short.
	
	
3. Enemies Drop loot:
	Light Soldier:
		* Drops health pack
		
	Infanty Soldier: 
		* Drops machine gun bullets
	
	Gunner:
		* Drops mega-sized health pack


4.  Improve All quake weapons with modern enhancements (not just changes in numbers):

		- Player has chance to not consume machinegun ammo when firing above 90% hp.
		- Player has chance to bleed enemies with bullet/pellet projectile guns.
		- Player has largely increased shotgun pellot count when under 50% HP. 
		- Player regenerates ammo passively which makes some options much more viable if you allow them to regenerate ammo.
		- Player receives increased damage/DPS with certain weapons after certain conditions are fufilled and they are lucky. 
		
5.   Weapons have random stats:
		- We still not there yet.
